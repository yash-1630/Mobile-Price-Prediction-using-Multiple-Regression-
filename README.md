📱 Mobile Price Prediction using Multiple Regression
📌 Overview
This project analyzes how RAM and Battery Capacity influence mobile phone prices using Multiple Regression Analysis in R programming.

🔍 Key Features
✅ Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using Kaggle's Mobile Prices 2023 dataset ✅ Evaluated model accuracy using R², Adjusted R², and Error Metrics ✅ Conducted residual analysis and data visualization for insights ✅ Explored correlations between RAM, Battery, and Price variations

📊 Results & Findings
📈 The regression model provides insights but has low predictive accuracy (R² = 0.1043), indicating that RAM and Battery alone do not fully determine prices. 💡 Future improvements will integrate Processor Type, Brand, and User Ratings for enhanced accuracy.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: Mobile Prices 2023. It contains various smartphone specifications like RAM, Battery, Processor, Ratings, and Price.

📜 Statistical Techniques
✅ Multiple Regression Model: Predicts price based on independent variables ✅ R² & Adjusted R²: Measures model accuracy ✅ Residual Analysis: Evaluates prediction errors ✅ Correlation Coefficients: Determines relationships between variables ✅ Error Metrics (SSE, MRSS, Residual SD): Assesses performance

🖥️ R Code Implementation
The project is implemented in R programming, where we fit a regression equation:

Price = a + b(RAM) + c(Battery)
